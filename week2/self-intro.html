        My name is Soo Weng Lok. I am 21 years old and I am a student from Dasein Academy of Art. I am interested in
        technology and design, especially computers and web development. I like learning new things and I always try to
        improve myself. In my free time, I enjoy playing games, watching videos and listening to music. I am a friendly
        and hardworking person and I always try my best to do things well. I hope to learn more web design skills in
        this course and create better websites in the future. I believe that practice will help me improve faster.
